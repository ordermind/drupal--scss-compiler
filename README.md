# SCSS Compiler
Module compiles scss files into css via [Leafo SCSS Compiler](https://github.com/leafo/scssphp/releases)
## Installation
1. Download last release of [Leafo SCSS Compiler](https://github.com/leafo/scssphp/releases) (Packagist version is outdated)
2. Rename it to `scssphp` and place into libraries directory (DRUPAL_ROOT/libraries/)
3. Install module and all SCSS files defined in libraries.yml will be compiled into css
## Usage
```yml
# my_module.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: {}
```
It will be compiled into public://scss_compiler/[theme_name]/styles.css
Also you can define `css_path` â€” path where to save the compiled file, full path from DRUPAL_ROOT, for example:
```yml
# my_module.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: { css_path: 'themes/my_theme/css/' }
```
All module settings are on the performance page.
