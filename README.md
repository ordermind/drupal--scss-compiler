# SCSS Compiler
Module compiles scss files into css via [ScssPhp Compiler](https://scssphp.github.io/scssphp/)
## Manual installation
1. Download last release of [ScssPhp Compiler](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp/releases)
2. Rename it to `scssphp` and place into libraries directory 
(DRUPAL_ROOT/libraries/)
3. Install module and all SCSS files defined in libraries.yml 
will be compiled into css
## Composer installation
Module could work even if compiler library in the vendor folder, but when 
the core will be updated manualy, the compiler library will be deleted 
from the vendor folder, so it installs to the drupal libraries folder,
but composer doesn't allow to install packages outside of the vendor 
folder, only via custom installers, so we use composer [custom-directory-installer](https://github.com/mnsami/composer-custom-directory-installer)
It allows us to change destination folder of package, by defining it manualy.

Add scssphp/scssphp to drupal-libraries path in composer.json, libraries path 
may be different from example, don't replace entire path from the example.
```json
"extra": {
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/libraries/{$name}": ["type:drupal-library", "scssphp/scssphp"]
  }
}
```
Install dependencies and module
```
composer require 'mnsami/composer-custom-directory-installer:^1.1' 
composer require 'scssphp/scssphp:^1.0' 
composer require 'drupal/scss_compiler'
```
## Usage
```yml
# my_module.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: {}
```
By default, compiled files are saved to public://scss_compiler

Also you can define `css_path` â€” path where to save the compiled file, 
full path from DRUPAL_ROOT, for example:
```yml
# my_module.libraries.yml
main:
  version: VERSION
  css:
    theme:
      scss/styles.scss: { css_path: 'themes/my_theme/css/' }
```
All module settings are on the performance page.
